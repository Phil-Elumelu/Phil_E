# CONNECTTEL CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
ConnectTel Telecom Company faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth.
The company's current customer retention strategies lack precision and
effectiveness, resulting in the loss of valuable customers to competitors.
To overcome this challenge, ConnectTel aims to develop a
robust customer churn prediction system for which you have been contacted
to handle as a Data Scientist. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine
learning techniques on available customer data, the company seeks to
accurately forecast customer churn and implement targeted retention
initiatives.

For my project i ran many kinds of analysis to find trends and relationships between the businesses services and customers churning like univariate analysis between of customer churning, contracts, gender and other factors to find out what type of customers the business retains and develop targeted campaigns to retain said customers. I used bivariate analysis to find relationships between each factor and customer churn rate finding the areas of improvement for connecttel to be able to gain the customers loyalty and thus increasing the revenue earned by the company. 

After the data pre-processing stage i moved on to creating my supervised models. FIrst i encoded the categorical variables like gender into numerical values that could be used in the model. Then afterwards using the libraries i had imported(LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier etc.) i ran a training model and a test model in the end to measure the accuracy ofthe model focusing on having less false negatives as it will be more important to predict whether a customer would churn or not so as to minimize revenue loss and gain customer loyalty and have a competitve edge in the telecommunication industry
